.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Class defining one-dimensional subset of an array. 

The slice class represents a one-dimensional subset of an array, specified by three parameters: start offset, size, and stride. The start offset is the index of the first element of the array that is part of the subset. The size is the total number of elements in the subset. Stride is the distance between each successive array element to include in the subset.
.PP
For example, with an array of size 10, and a slice with offset 1, size 3 and stride 2, the subset consists of array elements 1, 3, and 5.
