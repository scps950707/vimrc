__gnu_parallel::_RestrictedBoundedConcurrentQueue \- 
.PP
Double-ended queue of bounded size, allowing lock-free atomic access. \fBpush_front()\fP and \fBpop_front()\fP must not be called concurrently to each other, while \fBpop_back()\fP can be called concurrently at all times. \fCempty()\fP, \fCsize()\fP, and \fCtop()\fP are intentionally not provided. Calling them would not make sense in a concurrent setting.

Calling them would not make sense in a concurrent setting.
